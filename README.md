#CALDERA

How do you determine the supply and/or price of a digital asset? What make a crypto currency worth what it's worth? Speculation is one answer, but that is reliant on fixed and/or limited supply. This is fine for things like bitcoin, but what about shared digital assets or tokens that represent access to a single asset.
A good example of this is membership in an organization. There is no way to determine price unless a cap is set on the number of members or set a price directly. We have created a protocol that allows users to determine price and supply of such an asset. 
Caldera uses speculation to determine the value of a digital asset. All caldera assets have an infinite supply.
